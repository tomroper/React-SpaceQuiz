This Single Page Application is a quiz to see if an applicant is ready to join NASA and head to Mars. 
Their name is required to begin, otherwise they see and error message.

The App then moves through 2 confirmation screens and then begins a test. When the test begin a Timer component is trigered and gives the user 60 seconds to complete the quiz. If the user doesnt finish the test in 60 seconds they are rejected.
